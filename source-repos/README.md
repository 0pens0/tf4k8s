# Source Materials

We're leveraging modules from the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io) and other available open-source and commercial offerings.
If you're curious about the under-pinnings of the `experiments` folder, run the `clone-repos` script, then inspect the source at your leisure.

> Prerequisite: all you need is the `git` CLI.

```
./clone-repos.sh
